    <h3 id="Why%20do%20I%20make%20one?">Why do I make one?</h3>
    <p>
        Not that I hate the kernels shipped for the device but I like to tune & rice them myself.
    </p>

    <h3 id="What%20do%20I%20mean%20by%20rice?">What do I mean by rice?</h3>
    <p>
        By <i>rice</i> I mean
    <ul>
        <li>Upstreaming kernel to keep up-to-date with LTS.</li>
        <li>Updating the base sourcecode whenever CAF (codeaurora) releases new tags. </li>
        <li>Tuning the kernel to favour battery life without any performance compromisation.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="Is%20it%20safe%20to%20use?">Is it safe to use?</h3>
    <p>Yes, very much.</p>

    <h3 id="Which%20devices%20have%20received%20my%20custom%20kernel?">Which devices have received my custom kernel?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I don't own a lot of devices, only 2 out of which only one can be used for development. Name of my device is 
        Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 India or Redmi 5 Plus Global (these both are same devices, blame Xiaomi for horrible naming 
        system)
    </p>

    <h3 id="What%20changes%20have%20I%20made%20compared%20to%20kernel%20shipped%20by%20default%20in%20a%20ROM?">What
        changes have I made compared to kernel shipped by default in a ROM?</h3>
    <p>
        Well that totally depends what kernel is shipped with the ROM because in Redmi 5 Plus community most ROMs ship
        with my custom kernel.
        Only a few ROMs ship with different kernel which has nasty, old & broken stuff which I don't really like for
        e.g. a wakelock blocker, an out-of-tree governor made for Pixel, broken Dynamic STune Boost driver (which was
        fixed recently but I still don't like it) & etc.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Can%20I%20make%20A%20Custom%20Kernel%20for%20your%20device?">Can I make Custom Kernel for your device?</h3>
    <p>
        The answer for this question would be "<i>It totally depends</i>" based on the condition of the community or if 
        you really need a custom kernel & how strong the internal testing group of the device is and various other factors.
        But I will make custom kernel for the device I own regardless of all these conditions & since this is a hobby don't 
        ask for E.T.A of kernel release because <b>I'm a user too</b>.
